**Bugs:**  
> (None known currently)  

**AHK Todo/Wanted features:**  
> ~~**Dynamic Server list:-** Including preferably a player count.~~ Partially done.  
> **Gameconfig:-** Adding, backing up and removing.  
> **Visual setting tweak?**  
> **Log uploading:-** if Discord allows that from a URL. Pre-formatted message is also an option.  
> **FAQ:-** As soon as something is asked frequently.  
> **About tab blurb:-** As soon as I can be bothered.  
> **Build common expressions list:-** Take logs from multiple people and build list for blacklist.  
> **Rethink tools tab layout:-** separate log file list to different GUI. Replace with tool launch buttons.  
> **Resize launcher:-** if log list is being separated there is no need for the size, this negates the need for a big logo on the main tab.  
> **Pixel peep to get alignments 100%**  
> **Save Log Copy.**  
> **Find selected error line in the log viewer and scroll to that.**  
> **Log Backups-** Automatically backup logs older than 1 week? Prompt on connect?  
> **Context menu:** add more options, send to, copy to, delete.  
> **Live view of log:** in both normal and parsed modes. Checkbox?  
> **Rethink of UI layout:** Possibly switch  tools, about etc to menu system instead of tab.  

**C# Todo/Wanted features**  
> **Recreate launcher:-** including separate windows.
